        <p align="justify">Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management, popularly known as GITAM, was founded in 1980
            by an inspired group of eminent intellectuals and industrialists of Andhra Pradesh led by Dr. M. V. V. S.
            Murthi, former Member of Parliament and popular philanthropist.

            The vision of MAHATMA, the Father of the Nation was to see India as a socially and economically resurgent
            country and he looked upon education as an important means to achieve this goal. Gandhiji’s view of
            education was not narrow or sectarian. He envisaged universities as institutions of higher learning that
            transcend all linguistic, racial and other barriers. GITAM is committed to imbibe his values and abide by
            his philosophy.
            Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management (GITAM) is a private deemed university located in
            Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. Founded by the late Dr M. V. V. S. Murthi in 1980,in Visakhapatnam, it also
            has campus in Hyderabad and Bengaluru. It was previously affiliated with Andhra University under the name
            GITAM College, then gained autonomy status in the year 2007. GITAM is the first private engineering
            institute in the state to receive the University status.

            The campus in Visakhapatnam is the oldest of the bunch. It spreads across a little over 100 acres.
            Collectively, the three campuses have 19 institutions under their wing. Over the years, GITAM has taken part
            in many social activitieS and has also produced many renowned personalities.</p>
