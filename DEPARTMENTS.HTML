            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CYBER SECURITY (CS) Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected
                systems such as hardware, software and data from cyber-threats. What is Cyber Security?
                Cyber Security is a specialized field in Information Technology (IT) which is regarded as a
                substream in Computer Science.
                Computer security, cybersecurity, or information technology security (IT security) is the
                protection of computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of, or damage
                to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or
                misdirection of the services they provide.

                The field has become significant due to the expanded reliance on computer systems, the
                Internet, and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the
                growth of "smart" devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that
                constitute the Internet of things (IoT). Cybersecurity is also one of the significant
                challenges in the contemporary world, due to its complexity, both in terms of political
                usage and technology. Its primary goal is to ensure the system's dependability, integrity,
                and data privacy.
                Since the Internet's arrival and with the digital transformation initiated in recent years, the notion
                of cybersecurity has become a familiar subject in both our professional and personal lives.
                Cybersecurity and cyber threats have been consistently present for the last 50 years of technological
                change. In the 1970s and 1980s, computer security was mainly limited to academia until the conception of
                the Internet, where, with increased connectivity, computer viruses and network intrusions began to take
                off. After the spread of viruses in the 1990s, the 2000s marked the institutionalization[clarification
                needed] of cyber threats and cybersecurity.

                    the emission, behaviour and effects of electrons using electronic devices. Electronics uses
                    active devices to control electron flow by amplification and rectification, which
                    distinguishes it from classical electrical engineering, which only uses passive effects such
                    as resistance, capacitance and inductance to control electric current flow.
                    Electronics has hugely influenced the development of modern society. The identification of
                    the electron in 1897, along with the subsequent invention of the vacuum tube which could
                    amplify and rectify small electrical signals, inaugurated the field of electronics and the
                    electron age.[1] Practical applications started with the invention of the diode by Ambrose
                    Fleming and the triode by Lee De Forest in the early 1900s.

                    In the first decade of the twentieth century, electronics was taking its first steps through
                    thermionic valves. It was in this period, India had just begun its electrical power
                    generation schemes, but the electrical industry was yet non-existent in the country. In such
                    a situation, the decision of the planners of the Indian Institute of Science to establish
                    the Department of Electrical Technology (ET) as one of the first Departments of the
                    institute was bold and far reaching.This has enabled the institute to lay a strong
                    foundation for electrical science and technology in the country and provide an excellent
                    base for education, R&D, industry and utilities in this area
